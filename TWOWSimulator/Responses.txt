Hi, Billy Mays here for the original quick chop, the fastest, easiest, safest way to chop mince or dice any vegetable – guaranteed. Here’s how it works: Just place the vegetable on the board, give it a tap and you’ve got finely shredded cabbage in seconds for crunchy coleslaw. If you like salads, put all your ingredients in at the same time. Chicken salad, ham salad, even shrimp salad is all done with just a few taps. It has the power to chop nuts – almonds, walnuts, pecans. Use them for toppings for ice cream Sundays. Quick chop even has the muscle to chop ice ... amazing! Make delicious, mouth-watering salsa in seconds. It even works on tough vegetables like potatoes. Quick chop peels and chops garlic with just one tap. Keep tapping for freshly minced garlic. The secret is the six carbon steel blades, combined with the rotating action. Each time you tap, it rotates and chops on a different angle – and never misses a thing. One tap and you’ve got sliced onions. A few more taps for diced onions. Keep tapping for finely minced onions. It’s faster than a knife and the only tears you’ll cry are tears of joy. Clean-up is a breeze – just rinse it or put it in the dishwasher. Call now and you’ll get the original Quick Chop with rotating action for only $19.99. As a special bonus, we’ll also include our Quick Grater free. It comes with both course and fine blades, and it’s the best grater you’ll ever use for grating all types of cheeses. But to make this the best deal on TV, we’ll double the offer. You’ll get a second Quick Chop and a second Quick Grater. Just pay separate processing and handling. That means you get two of the original quick chops and two of the quick graters for only $19.99. Here’s how to order.

Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Putty, the easy way to fix, fill and seal virtually anything fast and make it last! Mighty Putty is not a glue, but a super-powered epoxy that you can mold to any shape and apply directly to most any surface for an everlasting bond. Ordinary epoxies are a mixing mess. With Mighty Putty, you just cut like dough, simply knead to activate, apply and let dry. It has the muscle to support up to 350 pounds. Rebuild a damage tool to work like new or make car repairs and save money. Drills, holes and screws can ruin your project. With Mighty Putty, you just cut, activate and apply. Here’s something you can’t do with glue: Mighty Putty seals leaks instantly. Use it on pipes and faucets for a permanent seal. As you knead, it activates, turning from green to white to show it’s ready to hold on tight. It has the strength to pull this fully loaded 80,000-pound tractor trailer! Now that’s the power of Mighty Putty! Whether it’s tile to wood, metal to glass, any job big or small, Mighty Putty repairs them all. Fill cracks in ceilings, walls, and floors. Mold it to furniture, sand and paint for a seamless repair. And it’s ideal for all your crafting projects. There’s nothing you can’t do with Mighty Putty. Call now and we’ll send you two powerful sticks of Mighty Putty for only $19.99. But through this exclusive TV offer, we’ll double it and send you two more sticks free. Mighty Putty will pay for itself the very first time.  But I’m not done yet. Call right now and I’ll triple the offer, and send you six sticks of Mighty Putty for the same old price of $19.99. Order now!

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.

What would happen if you combine a cheese grater with a plate? You’d have a plate that grates! Hi, Billy Mays here for the Grater Plater! It’s no ordinary plate. Watch this. Grate cheese with ease – Parmesan, Romano, even Asiago. There’s no wrong way to use it. Back and forth, side to side, round and round, all the cheese stays in the plate. Pass it around the dinner table and grate as you go. Use it for pasta, pizza or salads. For zest, it’s the best. Whether is a lemon, lime or orange, you get perfect results each and every time. You can’t mince garlic with one of these and if you use a press, it’s a mess! Watch this. You can puree garlic fast, quick and easy, and all the natural juices stay right in the plate. It gives you the consistency of garlic butter without the butter. Add a little olive oil and herbs, and it becomes a dipping plate. Soft enough for little hands and it won’t even pop a balloon! The secret is the hardened, tempered ceramic design that never dulls. It’s triple glazed so nothing sticks. Don’t cut a finger trying to grate ginger with one of these. The Grater Plater is the best ginger grater. There’s no strings and all the essence stay right on the plate. Use it for baking, chocolate, cinnamon – even coconut is no match for the Grater Plater. Call now and we’ll send you the Grater Plater for just $10. But I’m just getting started. With every order, we’ll include the Roll ‘n’ Peel. Take a clove and give it a roll. Peel all the garlic you like without ever touching it. You’ll even get the gathering brush to mix all the flavors together and top your favorite foods. But call right now and we’ll double this entire offer absolutely free. Just pay separate shipping and handling. You get it all, a huge value all for just $10. Here’s how to order.

Are you on your feet all day? Does the contact pounding cause your ankles, knees and back to ache? Hi, Billy Mays here for the world’s greatest insole, Impact Gel. Why am I smashing my hand with this hammer? To show you the amazing protection you get from Impact Gel. And this hammer is real. The same gel technology is used in our Impact Gel insoles. If you have sore, tired, aching feet, Impact Gel absorbs more shocking pressure than other insoles. Unlike regular insoles that break down over time, Impact Gel is injected into the areas that provide pressure relief where you need it most – the heals and balls of your feet. The gel never breaks down. And when impact occurs, the insole soaks up the shock and the force now ripples throughout the gel pads. No regular insoles can do that. Even after continuous pounding, these M&M’s don’t break. Imagine the relief you’ll feel in all kinds of shoes. They even work in cowboy boots. I use them, and they work. Talk about shock-absorbency … I’m going to run over my hand with this 6,000-pound car. That’s the power and protection of Impact Gel. Whether you’re a runner, a professional or a stay-at-home mom, you deserve the comfort of Impact Gel. Stop spending hundreds on inferior insoles. Remember, nothing absorbs a shock quite like Impact Gel. Call now and get a pair of our Impact Gel insoles for only $29.99. But that’s not all. We’ll also send you a pair of our Impact Gel inserts free. They’re perfect for dress shoes and casual wear. But I’m still not done. Call right now and we’ll double the offer. Just pay separate shipping and handling. That’s right, you’ll get two sets of insoles and two sets of inserts, a $90 value, all for $29.99. Here’s how to order.
